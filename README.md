# Planete Mars

This is a port to Phaser of the old unfinished game I did.

## Issues / To-dos

- Reuse game objects in a pool
- Bullets should have a better range when shot in movement
- Add basic enemies
- Player can be hurt and lose a life after reaching 0 'Ã©nergie'
- Create a screen to change the keyboard inputs and allow saving to local storage
- Save progress in local storage
- Create a screen to create new game / continue saved game
- Scaling issue on mobile, webgl glitches? Need to find a workaround
- Collision detection is too processor intensive for mobiles, need a more efficient solution
