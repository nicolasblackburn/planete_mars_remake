# Planete Mars

This is a port to Phaser of the old unfinished game I did.

## Issues / To-dos

- Update game objects scales on window resize
- Scaling issue on mobile, webgl glitches?
- Mobile controls: tap shoot, delay for pointer up event to allow shooting and moving at the same time
- Collision detection is too processor intensive for mobiles, need a more efficient solution
- Don't allow more than 3 bullets in the screen and reduce the range
- Add basic enemies
- Player can be hurt and lose a life after reaching 0 'Ã©nergie'
- Create a screen to change the keyboard inputs and allow saving to local storage
- Save progress in local storage
- Create a screen to create new game / continue saved gamesous
