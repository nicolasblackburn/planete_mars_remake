# Planete Mars

This is a port to Phaser of the old unfinished game I did.

## Issues / To-dos

- Apply Rich Davey scaling technic [http://www.photonstorm.com/phaser/pixel-perfect-scaling-a-phaser-game]
- Add mobile controls (pointer down move toward pointer, swipe shoots)
- Scaling depending on screen dimension, centered canvas
- Don't allow more than 3 bullets in the screen and reduce the range
- Add basic enemies
- Player can be hurt and lose a life after reaching 0 'énergie'
- Remove 'vies' and just keep 'énergie'
